Your Camunda setup looks quite comprehensive, involving two microservices with different workers and a BPMN process that coordinates them. Here’s a breakdown of what’s happening and suggestions to ensure the flow works as expected:

1. **Microservice 1** (`camunda2`):
    - Contains two workers: `ExampleWorker1` and `ExampleWorker2`.
    - Both workers are subscribed to separate external topics (`ExampleWorker1` and `ExampleWorker2`) and perform business logic when a task is fetched from their respective topics.
    - The BPMN file defines a process with a sequence that moves from `ExampleWorker1` to `ExampleWorker2` and then another worker, `ExampleWorker3`.

2. **Microservice 2** (`camunda3`):
    - Contains `ExampleWorker3`, which subscribes to the external task topic `ExampleWorker3`.
    - This completes the process chain initiated in `Microservice 1`.

3. **BPMN Workflow**:
    - The process starts with an event, proceeds to `ExampleWorker1`, then `ExampleWorker2`, and finally `ExampleWorker3`, before ending.
    - The tasks are linked via sequence flows, ensuring that the completion of one task triggers the next in the process.

### To ensure everything works smoothly:
1. **Check communication between workers**:
    - Ensure that your two microservices (`camunda2` and `camunda3`) are properly communicating. Camunda’s External Task pattern works by polling the Camunda engine for tasks from the workers, so network configuration and firewall rules between these services should allow this.
  
2. **Camunda Engine Setup**:
    - Ensure your Camunda engine (running on a separate service) is properly connected and accessible by both microservices. This should be handled by setting the proper configuration for the Camunda engine in both applications (`application.properties` or `application.yml`).

    For example, set in both `application.properties`:
    ```properties
    camunda.bpm.client.base-url=http://localhost:8080/engine-rest
    ```

3. **External Task Topics**:
    - The topics defined in your workers (`ExampleWorker1`, `ExampleWorker2`, and `ExampleWorker3`) must match exactly with those in the BPMN file (`camunda:topic` in each service task).

4. **Business Key**:
    - You’re using `externalTask.getBusinessKey()` in your logs. Ensure that the process instances are being created with a valid business key. This can be used to track the same process across different workers.

5. **Spring Boot Application Names**:
    - Set a proper `spring.application.name` for each microservice to identify them correctly in your logs or when debugging.
    
    For example, in `application.properties` of each microservice:
    - `camunda2`:
    ```properties
    spring.application.name=camunda2
    ```

    - `camunda3`:
    ```properties
    spring.application.name=camunda3
    ```

### Additional Suggestions:
1. **Testing**:
    - After deployment, test the workflow by creating a process instance via the Camunda REST API and monitor each worker to ensure tasks are executed in sequence.
    
    Example request to start a process instance with a business key:
    ```bash
    curl -X POST "http://localhost:8080/engine-rest/process-definition/key/Process_0hnn5s4/start" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"businessKey": "my-business-key"}'
    ```

2. **Task Timeouts**:
    - If tasks are long-running, consider handling timeouts or retries in your workers. Camunda allows you to specify task retries in case of failure.
